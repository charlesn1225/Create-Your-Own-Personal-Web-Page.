        <h1>Charles Nshimiyimana</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Uganda within a refugee camp, my journey, Charles Nshimiyimana, has been one of resilience and diversity. I am currently exploring the expansive world of Information Technology (IT), where my passion for helping others and my love for soccer converge.</p>

        <h3>My Passion for Soccer and Helping Others</h3>
        <p>Soccer is not just a game for me; it's a way of life. Playing FIFA and engaging in soccer activities, coupled with my commitment to volunteering at non-profits, forms the core of my interests. This passion seamlessly blends with my IT pursuits. For instance, using my web development skills, I can create platforms for organizing soccer events and enhancing the reach of non-profit organizations. My project, African Youth Ministry, aims to establish a digital community for sharing ideas, stories, and managing activities, thus marrying my IT knowledge with my love for soccer and community service.</p>
